# A Sample Rest API with Spring

A sample rest api with Spring...This is not a production-grade app!!!! 
The project should be seen as an exercise that aims at illustrating how to create a simple REST API. 
It also shows how to make use of Swagger for documentation purposes - once you run the app you can 
access the generated documentation on: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html. The project also illustrates the  
usage of an application.yaml instead of application.properties file and makes use of Docker Compose to create an instance of MySQL DB. 
The relevant yaml file can be found in folder local. You can find more information about this here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/.
The project can be improved by adding binding models, services, authentication, proper storage of credentials, etc.
